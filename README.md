# nested-shortcuts

Ever since leaving [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) for a Wayland alternative, I've been missing the ["awful" menus](https://awesomewm.org/doc/api/libraries/awful.menu.html), which gave me some kind of multi-layer keyboard shortcuts for launching applications.  
Since I was not able to find any standalone replacement application launcher featuring fully configurable menu hierarchy and keyboard shortcuts, I eventually wrote my own.

## TODO

This is still very much WIP. TODO:

- User-configuration for menu entries
- Make it look nice (theme)
- Make it resize itself to content?
- Close on lost window focus or otherwise steal focus from other windows, like other app launchers such as rofi

## Configuration
